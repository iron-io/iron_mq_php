This directory contains a few sets of code that detail how to use the IronMQ client library.

To use these examples, copy the 'sample_iron.ini' file to 'iron.ini' and fill in with your details, or put a copy
of your 'iron.json' file in this directory. The IronMQ client will automatically parse these files and use them for
configuration.

Each test will create a list of queues, and clean themselves up after running. If the test code fails for some reason,
or you comment out the deleteQueue() commands, you can manually delete the queues from your HUD interface.

You can also enable debug for IronMQ by uncommenting the line near the top of each file. This will allow you to see
the API enpoints that are being posted to.

Enjoy!
